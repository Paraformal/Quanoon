Failure to address this issue in a\r\ntimely manner would cause banking institutions to\r\nexperience opperational problems or even bankruptcy\r\nand could cause the disruption of financial markets\r\nAs a result, banking institutions must take the\r\nnecessary steps to ensure that problems and disruptions\r\n. are minimised\r\nThis paper is prepared by the Basle Committee on *\r\nBanking Supervision in order to serve as reference\r\non the Year 2000 issue for central banks and other\r\n:banking supervisors. It contains four parts that\r\ni) put the issue in perspective; (ii) outline the\r\nsteps institutions need to follow to resolve the\r\nproblem; (iii) discuss key issues that need to be\r\naddressed to resolve the problem successfully; and\r\niv) identify how bank supervisors can help assure)\r\nsuccess. A more technical and detailed discussion\r\nof the Year 2000 issue is provided in Appendix A\r\nAppendix B describes the components that go into\r\na successful action plan. Appendix C provides a\r\nshort checklist summarising some of the key factors\r\nthat banks must address to successfully meet the\r\nYear 2000 challenge\r\n''\r\nI. THE YEAR 2000 IN PERSPECTIVE\r\nBanks rely heavily  on automation to manage *\r\ninformation. If automated applications failed to\r\nwork properly, it would be difficult if not\r\nimpossible to conduct business. While the Year 2000\r\nproblem is often seen as a technical issue, it is\r\nmuch more than a technical one because of the\r\nimplications that not dealing with it properly could\r\nhave on each and every business line within the\r\nbank. Every manager must be actively involved in\r\nassuring that the business line is Year 2000 compliant\r\nTop management needs not only to recognise the\r\nstrategic importance of the issue but also to monitor\r\nplans and progress actively across the bank\r\nThe Year 2000 is particularly challenging because\r\nit is not just internal to a bank. Banks have many\r\nautomated linkages and interdependencies with\r\ncorrespondents and customers. For larger banks that\r\ndeal in multiple currencies and provide wide ranges\r\nof products in many countries around the world, the\r\nchallenge is particularly great because many of these\r\napplications are interdependent. If applications are\r\nnot able to work together properly, significant\r\nproblems could develop. All of these interdependencies\r\nmust be addressed and tested to assure that problems\r\nare not present. Similarly, banks rely on third party\r\nservice providers or vendors for many applications\r\nThese applications not only need to be made compliant\r\nbut also must be thoroughly tested within each bank\r\nto assure that perform properly for the particular\r\nenvironment and application interfaces fround in each\r\n.institution\r\n''\r\nComplicating the resolution of the Year 2000 issue\r\non a global basis are the differing situations\r\nfound in many markets and countries around the\r\nworld. The scheduled introduction of the Euro is\r\nplacing significant competing demands on scarce\r\ntechnical resources for institutions active in that\r\nmarket. Other new or modified financial trading or\r\ndelivery systems are being introduced in other\r\nmarkets. In some countries, other policy or business\r\nobjectives may divert technical resources from the\r\n,financial sector. Even within the financial sector\r\nthere are differing priorities for banks, securities\r\nfirms, and insurance companies. These and other\r\nfactors lead to widely varying amounts of attention\r\nbeing devoted to Year 2000 issues by individual\r\n.institutions\r\n,Since the earliest days of electronic computers\r\nprogrammers have used two digits to represent the\r\nyear in date fields (YYMMDD). In the 1960s when this\r\nconvention became standard, the two-digit representation\r\nmade economic sense because it economised computer\r\nmemory and saved storage space. Even in the 1980s, few\r\nbelieved that applications being developed then would\r\nstill be running into the year 2000. Unfortunately\r\nthis belief was ill founded. While many newer\r\napplications are Year 2000 compliant, many older\r\napplications upon which compliant applications depend\r\nor interact continue to run. In addition, the\r\nenvironmental software and hardware on which an\r\napplication runs may not be compliant. Assuming that\r\nany application is Year 2000 compliant without\r\nappropriate analysis and testing poses substantial\r\n.risks\r\n''\r\nThe Year 2000 problem exists because a two-digit *\r\nrepresentation of the year will be interpreted in\r\nmany applications to mean the year 1900, not 2000\r\nunless the date or program, logic is modified. Many\r\ncalculations will either indicate that transactions\r\nhave been open for nearly a hundred years or produce\r\nnegative numbers. New files may not be recognised\r\nas the most recent data, causing current files to\r\nbe erased or archived as old data. These and other\r\nlogic issues have the potential for causing problems\r\nfor debt collection, ageing of information, calculating\r\ninterest rates, etc. and could significantly disrupt\r\nnormal business operations. Also, when dates are\r\ncompared, customer billings may change from charges\r\nto refunds and vice versa. Even building systems\r\nsuch as elevators or climate control systems may\r\nbe affected because of embedded logic to facilitate\r\n.maintenance and operations\r\nAll of these factors make the Year 2000 a formidable *\r\nchallenge, Whether the banking industry has the\r\nability to rise to this challenge and avoid serious\r\npoblems as the date change occurs will be determined\r\nby the actions that individual banks and the banking\r\ncommunity more generally take between now and the\r\nYear 2000. To delay work on the issue runs the risk\r\nthat all of the code modifications, testing and other\r\nchanges cannot be done in a timely manner. Unlike\r\nmost projects involving technology, the time certain\r\nnature of 1999 becoming 2000 makes it impossible to\r\ndelay the event and full implementation of corrective\r\n.actions\r\n''\r\nII- ACTION PLANS FOR MANAGING THE YEAR 2000 PROCESS\r\nAll the indications are that a chieving Year 2000 *\r\ncompliance will be both complex and resource intensive\r\nLimited time exists and extensions are not possible\r\n.because the century date change is a fixed reality\r\nDetailed plans must be developed and resources\r\n.identified and secured to achieve the objective\r\nOrganisations that are not well advanced in their\r\nYear 2000 efforts are going to be particularly\r\nchallenged and will need to move quickly. All\r\nbanking institutions need to assess where they and\r\ntheir correspondents and customers stand and to\r\n.begin thinking about contingency plans\r\nAddressing the Year 2000 requires that every bank *\r\nhave an action plan. The complexity of the plan may\r\nvary from one bank to another depending upon size\r\nand the extent to which an organisation relies on\r\noutside vendors and service providers. However, even\r\nsmall banks with no internally developed applications\r\nmust have a plan for dealing with the vendors and\r\ntheir equipment and systems with embedded chips. While\r\nindividual organisations may have their own ways of\r\ndescribing their plans, one way to look at a good\r\naction plan is to think of it as consisting of the\r\nfollowing phases. The specific actions to be taken\r\n.in each phase are provided in more detail in Appendix B\r\na) Developing a strategic approach)\r\nThis phase includes establishing Year 2000 as a\r\nstrategic objective at the highest levels within the\r\nbank, developing a process to communicate the objective\r\nthroughout the banking organisation, and assessing\r\nthe resource implications of the Year 2000 at a very\r\n.high level\r\nAt this time, organisations should be well past *\r\n.this phase in addressing issues\r\nb) Creating organisational awareness\r\nMaking certain that the strategic importance of *\r\nthe Year 2000 as a business objective is understood\r\nand appreciated throughout the organisation may be\r\nthe most important phase in the action plan. The\r\nrecognition that the Year 2000 may be a survival\r\nissue requires not only a visible commitment from\r\ntop management for its successful resolution as a\r\nstrategic priority but also an awareness of its\r\nimportance by staff at all levels. Line management\r\nneeds to understand the issue and its implications\r\nand accept ownership of the issue. Responsibilities\r\nshould be clearly assigned. This phase have four\r\nobjectives: creating visibility; ensuring commitment\r\nidentifying resources; and specifying specific\r\n.strategic objectives at a business line level\r\nOrganisations should also be past this phase in *\r\n.their Year 2000 project\r\n''\r\nc) Assessing actions and developing detailed plans)\r\nThis phase moves the project from concept to *\r\nconcrete actions. Detailed inventories of what must\r\nbe done are developed, covering centralised and\r\ndecentralised hardware, software, and nerworks as\r\nwell as equipment with embedded computer chips and\r\nlogic. The inventories should include all aspects\r\nof business line activities whether internal to the\r\nbank or external to it. Risks should be quantified\r\n.and priorities set based on these risks\r\nWhile target dates for finishing this phase may *\r\nvary from one country to another, organisations are\r\nexpected to have completed this phase or be very\r\nclose to completing it by September 1997 in many\r\n.countries\r\nd) Renovating systems, applications and equipment\r\nThis is the only phase of the process that is *\r\nprimarily technical. During this phase, the necessary\r\nfixing of operating systems, applications, hardware\r\nand equipment takes place. The development of\r\ncontingency plans that identify alternative approaches\r\nif renovations lag or fail is an important part of\r\n.this phase\r\nOrganisations should be well into this phase at *\r\nthis time. Renovation work for significant\r\napplications that need to be tested with third\r\nparties must be completed with enough time to\r\nallow for thorough testing. In countries where\r\nYear 2000 preparations are well in hand, completion\r\nof this high priority work is being targeted for\r\nmid-1998. These countries also typically target\r\nthat all renovation work be completed no later\r\n.than the end of 1998\r\ne) Validating the renovation through testing)\r\nTesting represents the largest single task in the *\r\nYear 2000 project. Detailed test shedules must be\r\ndeveloped and coordinated with correspondents\r\nand customers. Data flows, internally and with\r\nthird parties must be thoroughly tested while both\r\n.the sender and receiver simulate Year 2000 conditions\r\nIn countries where Year 2000 preparations are well *\r\nin hand, for at least larger institutions and all\r\nsignificant applications, the validation phase is\r\nbeing targeted for completion by the end of 1998\r\nAll validation work should be completed by mid 1999\r\nOnly with this schedule will there be sufficient\r\ntime for industry and business wide testing with\r\n.all correspondents and customers during 1999\r\nf) Implementing tested, compliant systems)\r\nImplementation requires careful planning to make *\r\nsure that interrelated applications are coordinated\r\nas to when they go into production. The implementation\r\nphase also requires monitoring of progress by service\r\n.providers and vendors\r\n''\r\nIII. ISSUES\r\nAddressing the Year 2000 represents a major and *\r\ncomplex issue to manage. As organisations have\r\ndeveloped their detailed plans, a group of issues\r\n.have surfaced that deserve particular attention\r\nWhile several of these issues have been discussed\r\n,in describing the challenge and its management\r\nthey are highlighted in more detail here because\r\nof frequent misunderstandings or inadequate\r\n.attention\r\nCertification\r\nCertification has been a recurring and confusing *\r\nissue for many institutions. Many institutions and\r\nespecially smaller institutions believe that if a\r\nvendor certifies a particular product as being\r\n.Year 2000 compliant, they need not worry about it\r\nThere are two fallacies to this idea. First, some\r\nvendors indicate that their product is compliant\r\nwhen in fact it is not. Second, even of the product\r\nis compliant, it still must be tested by the\r\ninstitution to make sure that it runs properly within\r\nthe institution's own environment and interfaces\r\nproperly with other applications. At least some\r\nlevel of testing by the business line area will be\r\n.required to assure true compliance\r\nVendor management\r\nThird party vendors pose special risks because *\r\nthe amount of oversight and control that an\r\nindividual bank can influence is limited. As a\r\nresult, banks need to have a clear understanding\r\nof vendor plans and hold vendors accountable. If\r\nkey targets are not met, contingency plans should\r\nbe in place to change vendors, complete work\r\n.internally, or otherwise adjust to vendor failure\r\nTarget dates\r\nTarget dates for testing are critical both *\r\ninternally and externally. Most institutions have\r\nbeen developing target dates for testing for\r\ninternal use but have not been active in communicating\r\nthese dates to correspondents and customers. Because\r\nmeaningful testing often requires testing internally\r\nand with external parties. The coordination of test\r\nplans with correspondents and large, active customers\r\nbecome very important to the institution. Indeed\r\nsetting priorities and internal target dates will\r\ndepent to some extent on whem external testing\r\nbecomes feasible. Especially for larger institutions\r\npayment systems, clearance and settlement systems\r\nand similar utilities, communicating test plans for\r\napplications having external interfaces becomes\r\n.crucial for the industry-wide planning process\r\nFor institution that may be somewhat lagging in *\r\ntheir Year 2000 efforts to date, the need to\r\ncommunicate meaningful target dates for testing\r\nposes a dilemma. Not communicating readiness dates\r\nfor external testing now or indicating a date that is\r\ntoo far out in the future sends immediate\r\nindications to the financial community that the\r\ninstitution may be lagging in Year 2000 efforts. On\r\nthe other hand, communication a target date that\r\nappears acceptable but which might not be met runs\r\nthe risk of having credibility questioned even more\r\nseverely if the target is missed. Even internally\r\nas institutions think about setting target dates\r\nfor testing or other project milestones, they need\r\nto recognise that the century date change is\r\ninevitable. Setting optimistic targets that barely\r\nmake compliance possible may be only diguising the\r\n.real problem and issue for the organisation\r\n''\r\nSpillover business risks\r\nSpillover business risks and opportunities *\r\nrepresent and area that is often overlooked when\r\ndeveloping Year 200 plans. Typically, institutions\r\nfocus first on the internal efforts necessary to\r\nbecome compliant. Yet, the Year 2000 issue can also\r\nbe a survival issue for customers. Failure of\r\ncustomers to make the necessary adjustments can lead\r\nto a loss of business and loss of asset values for\r\nthe bank. On the other hand, having a strong Year 2000\r\nprogram may open strategic opportunities to market\r\nthe readiness posture of the institution. In any\r\nevent, credit and relationship officers should\r\nalready be cognisant of their customer's readiness\r\ntracking progress over time, estimating possible\r\nbusiness ramifications if customers fail to become\r\ncompliant, and developing contingency plans as\r\n.appropriate\r\nMergers and acquisitions\r\nMergers and acquisitions represent another area *\r\nwhere Year 2000 readiness should be taken into\r\naccount because such activity would place additional\r\nburden on scarce technical and managerial resources\r\nof the organisations. At minimum, a rigorous due\r\ndiligence on Year 2000 prepardness should be\r\nconducted in order to assess the status of the\r\ninstitutions would affect Year 2000 plans, actions\r\nand ultimately readiness. For organisations that\r\nare strtched in meeting Year 2000 compliance\r\nacquiring another institution would be highly risky\r\nIndeed, the possibility of being acquired might\r\nbe an approach to contingency planning. However\r\nas time passes, there is decreasing ability for\r\nany organisation to absorb a non-compliant one\r\nand make the necessary changes before the century\r\n.date change\r\nSatellite operations and foreign activities\r\nSatellite operations and foreign activities pose *\r\na significant risk for many institutions, While\r\ninventorying mainframe and other applications\r\nunder the control of a centralised information\r\nsystems management may be relatively easy, departmental\r\napplications unknown to the centralised operations\r\nare increasingly common. Many of these applications\r\nare essential risk monitoring and business decision\r\ntools. Extra effort is needed to identify these\r\napplications and make certain that they are compliant\r\nMaking business line staff at all levels aware of\r\nthe Year 2000 issue is essential if problems are\r\n.to be avoided\r\nSimilarly, foreign and decentralised operations *\r\nfrequently have applications specific to the local\r\nmarket trading activity or the local currency. Staff\r\nin these locations are often not as aware of corporate\r\nissues like the Year 2000 as staff would be at the\r\nhead office. As a result, the likelihood increases\r\nthat applications-potentially significant ones-would\r\nnot be picked up in the inventory or appropriately\r\n.addressed\r\n''\r\nSecurity issues\r\nSecurity issues arise and will become more pressing *\r\nas the urgency of the Year 2000 increase. Normally\r\nsound security controls may be relaxed as consultants\r\nand subcontractors for consultants undergo less\r\nrigorous background checks before being granted\r\naccess to bank systems and records. Date dependent\r\nsecurity applications may be turned off to facilitate\r\ntesting. As businesses focus more on resolving\r\ninterconnectivity concerns, resources normally\r\n.focused on security controls may be diverted\r\nCost control\r\nCost control represents a problem area for many *\r\ninstitutions. In particular, the adequacy of budgets\r\nbecomes an issue. Many organisations appear to be\r\nunderestimating he costs of testing by not recognising\r\nthat many tests will have to be performed multiple\r\ntimes as vendors change releases or operating system\r\nenvironments or applications change. Additionally\r\nbusiness line management often fails to recognise\r\nthat the largest share of the testing burden will\r\n.ultimately fall to them\r\nTechnical resource sarcities are also getting *\r\nworse with the passage of time. Institutions are\r\nalready experiencing significant turnover of key\r\nstaff as salaries are bid up ever higher in the\r\nmarket. Bonuses and special retention packages\r\nare being used in many institutions to address the\r\n.turnover issue\r\nOutside consultants are facing similar demands *\r\nresulting in higher costs. Here however, the issue\r\nis not just cost but the quality (skill and\r\nintegrity of the consultant and the level of\r\nconfidence one can have that the consultant will\r\ncontinue to exist if problems are encountered. As\r\na result of all of these factors, many organisations\r\nare finding it necessary to increase budget estimates\r\n.sometimes several times and often significantly\r\nMonitoring\r\nMonitoring Year 2000 progress should be a high *\r\npriority for every institution. The role that the\r\nadult function plays in the monitoring process\r\nshould be clearly defined, proactive, and clearly\r\nvisible at the highest levels. Follow up on audit\r\nexceptions should be tracked carefully and on a\r\ntimely basis. Control mechanisms need to be developed\r\nspecifically for monitoring Year 2000 progress\r\nand senior management and directors need to be\r\nmonitoring progress on a regular basis as one of\r\n.the highest priorities of the institution\r\n''\r\nPotential systemic issues\r\nPotential systemic issues need to be identified *\r\nThe Year 2000 issue is not one that will present\r\nproblems only to those who fail to rise to the\r\n\" challenge. For large banks and industry \"utilities\r\nthat serve the entire banking community by offering\r\nservices or products not readily available elsewhere\r\nproblems focused in a single location could rapidy\r\n.affect others if payments fail to move as expected\r\nPotential weak links in the payment chain need to\r\nbe identified as early as possible with appropriate\r\n.contingency plans developed and followed as necessary\r\nCredit issues with sustemic implications can also\r\narise if very large customers or classes of customers\r\nbecome unable to conduct business. Obligations may\r\nnot be met and collateral values can deteriorate\r\nrapidly. While the sustemic implications of Year 2000\r\ncredit issues may take somewhat longer to manifest\r\n.themselves, they are nonetheless real\r\nOutside ouditors and public reports\r\nOutside auditors and public reports are likely to *\r\nbecome an issue at the end of the current fiscal\r\nyear for some organisations. In some countries\r\nlike the United States, the decision has already\r\nbeen made that Year 2000 renovation costs must be\r\n.accounted for in the year in which they are incurred\r\nWhile the accounting profession is still debating\r\nwhether such costs will have to be disclosed as a\r\nspecific item, there is building consensus that\r\norganisations appearing to be unable to be Year 2000\r\ncompliant for material businesses or applications\r\nwill have to have this risk specifically noted in\r\ncertified statements. At what point such disclosure\r\n.begins to be required remains uncertain\r\nIV. ROLE FOR BANK SUPERVISORS\r\nBank supervisors clearly cannot solve the Year 2000 *\r\nchallenge; only institutions can do that for\r\nthemselves. However, bank supervisors can play a\r\n.constructive role in a number of ways\r\n''\r\nPromoting increased awareness\r\nPromoting increased awareness of the issue is *\r\nprobably both the simplest and most effective\r\nrole that bank supervisors can play. Identifying\r\nthe seriousness of the problem through alerts\r\nor other public notices that are carefully balanced\r\nand factual has been used successfully in a number\r\nof countries. In some cases, these public notices\r\nhave included helpful guidance on low institutions\r\nmight effectively address the issue. Direct contact\r\nwith industry groups or individual institutions\r\ncan also be used to increase the awareness of senior\r\n.management\r\nEstablishing targets and benchmarks for the industry\r\nEstablishing targets and benchmarks for the *\r\nindustry is another way to help assure progress. While\r\ndifferent market circumstances may suggest that such\r\ntargets will differ from country to country, having\r\nclear expectations helps institutions develop their\r\nown plans and furthers opportunities for external\r\ntest plans. Several countries have already offered\r\n.such benchmarks for their institutions\r\nIndustry-wide status assessments\r\nIndustry-wide status assessments on progress can *\r\nalso be helpful. Bank supervisors are uniquely\r\npositioned to know the status of progress in each\r\ninstitution. If issues develop in particular\r\n,locations or with particular types of entities\r\njudicious public observations on the general level\r\nof progress may encourage the reallocation of\r\n.resources to Year 2000 projects in these sectors\r\nProactive supervisory pressures\r\nProactive supervisory pressures directed at *\r\nspecific problems and institutions is the strongest\r\ntool available to bank supervisors. While banks\r\nare the only ones that can make their applications\r\ncompliant, supervisors can heighten the level of\r\nattention Year 2000 issues are receiving within\r\nthe bank through a variety of supervisory tools. If\r\ndespite all efforts of the supervisors, a bank or\r\ngroup of banks are going to have significant\r\nproblems, the supervisors should consider what\r\ncontingency plans are needed to deal with the\r\n.consequences\r\nV. SUMMARY\r\nThe Year 2000 issue is potentially the biggest *\r\n.challenge ever faced by the financial industry\r\nEvery automated system including equipment with\r\ncomputer chips embedded inside is potentially at\r\nrisk and must be analysed and renovated or replaced\r\nif needed. Unlike most automation projects that\r\ncan be staggered as to schedule and delayed if\r\nproblems are encountered, all critical renovations\r\nmust be addressed at once with no possibility for\r\nextending roll out deadlines. If resources and\r\ntime prevent some non-critical applications from\r\nbeing renovated, the implications of such deferrals\r\nshould be thoroughly analysed. As individual\r\napplications are addressed, they will have to be\r\ntested. In an age with extensive linkages among\r\napplications and interconnectivity among institutions\r\nthe testing process is enormous because tests must\r\nbe done repeatedly as new components become compliant\r\nInstitutions that are not already addressing the\r\nYear 2000 date change as a strategic priority need\r\n.to focus on this challenge immediately\r\n''\r\nSeptember 1997\r\nAppendix A\r\nThe Year 2000 Challenge in more detail\r\nOrigin and Impact\r\nSince the earliest days of electronic computers *\r\nprogrammers have used two digits to represent the\r\nyear in date fields (YYMMDD). While many newer\r\napplications are Year 2000 compliant, many older\r\napplications upon which compliant applications\r\ndepend or interact continue to run. Assuming that\r\nany application is Year 2000 compliant without\r\nappropriate analysis and testing poses subtantial\r\n.risks\r\nFurther complexities to the issue are introduced *\r\nby other comsiderations such as the use of reserved\r\nvalues such as using 99 in the year field to indicate\r\nthat a file should be saved forever, archived, or\r\ntreated differently in some way. Even before 2000\r\nis reached, some applications will start behaving\r\nbadly as, in this example, records for the year 1999\r\nwill be treated as special files and handled other\r\nthan normally. Finally, all programs will need to\r\nbe checked to see that leap year is properly handled\r\n.in 2000\r\nThere is no single way of fixing existing *\r\napplications or databases. Two of the most common\r\napproaches are to add two digits to the year field\r\nCCYYMMDD) or a technique called windowing, which)\r\nanalyses the two digit year field and automatically\r\nrecognises years under a specified number (say 60\r\nas being 20yy while years over the number are\r\nrecognised as being 19yy. Other fixes are also\r\nappropriate as permanent or temporary measures to\r\n.address particular applications\r\n:Applications affect all areas of the business *\r\nthe front office, the middle and back offices, the\r\ncustomer delivery system, and management information\r\nand decision support systems. Because applications\r\nare frequently interdependent on each other, all\r\ninterdependencies must be identified and thoroughly\r\ntested every time one element in the chain is\r\n.modified\r\n.Making the appropriate changes is complex *\r\n.Different situations require different solutions\r\nAdding two digits affects the amount of memory\r\nand storage space needed and can affect performance\r\nwith larger records to process. Windowing requires\r\nadded calculations whenever a date is encountered\r\nand can affect performance. Either approach can\r\n.affect how one application interacts with another\r\nFor example, if a four-digit representation for\r\nthe year is chosen, linking applications that expect\r\nto receive only two digits will require further\r\nmodifications to assure correct communication. Every\r\ntime an application is modified to be Year 2000\r\ncompliant, it will have to be tested against every\r\nother application with which there are linkages\r\nSuch testing has to be done not only internally\r\nbut also with correspondents and customers to\r\nassure that interdependencies work properly. Because\r\ncompliant applications become ready to be implemented\r\non a sequential basis, testing will be an ongoing\r\n.and repetitive process\r\n''\r\nAreas Affected\r\nThe potential for Year 2000 problems pervades *\r\nvirtually every area of an institution. Applications\r\nrelying on dates are clearly vulnerable. However\r\nmany applications that do not appear to rely on\r\ndates use dates in ways that are often not apparent\r\nto the user such as in file naming conventions or\r\nwhere the date is part of a key. Wherever dates\r\nare used, they must be indentified, checked for\r\nbeing compliant and addressed by appropriate change\r\n.when necessary\r\nAll applications are vulnerable regardless of *\r\n.whether they are developed internally or externally\r\nApplications developed by third parties may be\r\nespecially vulnerable because reliance must be\r\n.placed on semeone else to make the necessary changes\r\nAfter changes are made, a bank must test the\r\napplication to see that it works properly in its\r\nunique environment. Testing is essential because\r\nvendor applications almost always require current\r\nor at least recent releases for operating systems\r\nor utilities upon which the application depends. If\r\na bank is not current in its version control, compliant\r\n.applications may fail\r\nComputer operating systems are vulnerable because *\r\ndates play a crucial role in file maintenance and\r\nperformance optimisation routines that are invisible\r\nto the user. Access control and security systems are\r\naffected and could lock out users both logically\r\nfrom automated applications and physically from\r\n.buildings or departmental areas\r\nHardware is also affected. Mainframes are particularly\r\nvulnerable as individual components may be of widely\r\ndifferent vintages and a single non-compliant\r\n-component could affect the entire system. Mini\r\ncomputers and PCs may also be affected. ATM machines\r\nor communications equipment have built in dating\r\nfeatures that must be identified, tested, and\r\n.corrected where necessary\r\nInternal communications networks and public *\r\n.carriers have many date sensitive components\r\nAssuring that all problems are identified and made\r\ncompliant requires carefully designed tests involving\r\n.both applications and the network/carrier\r\nEnvironmental and other systems (heating and cooling\r\nsystems, elevators, vauts, facsimile machines, etc\r\nalso may have both date sensitive software and\r\nhardware with embedded computer chips that may\r\n.have hidden date sensitive elements\r\n''\r\nRisks and costs\r\nSignificant risks exist in not making all *\r\n.necessary changes and thoroughly testing systems\r\nOperational risks are obfious. Failure to have\r\nfully operational automated systems can prevent\r\neven simple business functions from being completed\r\nbecause manual or other alternatives may not be\r\nfeasible if processing volumes are sizeable or\r\n.information exchanges are extensive\r\nAny operational problems immediately become *\r\nreputational and legal risks as correspondents\r\nand clients react to business problems. If\r\nsignificant banks face problems, the systemic\r\nimplications could be extensive. Consulants\r\nestimate that legal costs alone could be in the\r\nhundreds of billions of dollars if problems are\r\nextensive in the industry. Such estimates clearly\r\nsuggest the magnitude of the strategic risk faced\r\n.by a bank and the industry more generally\r\nBecause correspondents and customers are also *\r\nsubject to the Year 2000 issue, they too must make\r\nthe necessary changes to conduct business normally\r\nTesting normal connectivity and message transfers\r\nwith correspondents and customers is essential but\r\nnot enough. If they have not also made the necessary\r\nadjustments to their own systems, they could pose\r\ncredit and liquidity risks to the bank. Credit\r\nofficers need to understand the Year 2000 risks\r\nfaced by their customers and how well their customers\r\nare managing these risks. Current financial\r\nperformance will not be an indication of future\r\nperformance for organisations that have not developed\r\nsound plans and provided for appropriate resources\r\n.to carry them out\r\nThe costs that the banking industry will need to *\r\nincur to address the Year 2000 are extensive. The\r\nGarther Group has publicly estimated that it will\r\ncost between US$ 300-US$ 600 billion worldwide\r\njust to complete needed changes and testing. Every\r\nline of code in every program needs to be reviewed\r\nat costs typically estimated at about US$ 1 per\r\nline. Costs for global banks are frequently estimated\r\nin the hundreds of millions of dollars. Smaller\r\nbanks with few in-house developed applications will\r\nstill incur substantial costs to test thoroughly\r\n.applications modified by others\r\nSkilled technical resources are already scare *\r\nand will become even more scarce as the deadline\r\napproaches. Already salaries for certain specialists\r\nare rising and key staff are being bid away by other\r\ncompanies. Consultants with top reputations are\r\nheavily committed, and new clients are accepted\r\nonly on a very selective basis. As time passes\r\nbanks will be forced to turn to consultants with\r\nlittle or no demonstrated performance record and\r\n.uncertain futures\r\n''\r\n.Test facilities also can pose a challenge *\r\nEstablishing a test environment for live testing\r\nusing dates in the year 2000 is not easily done. If\r\n.possible, dedicated systems should be used\r\nAlternatively, a production system might be shut\r\ndown and re-established for the Year 2000 testing\r\nbut such an approach can pose significant risks\r\nbecause moving an advanced date backwards (i.e\r\nfrom 20xx to 19xx) for the operating system is\r\noften a difficult and time consuming process. Also\r\nthe number of weekends and holidays available to\r\nconduct testing is constantly shrinking. Renting\r\ncomputer time from, third parties service providers\r\nmay be possible but, like consultants, their resources\r\n.are being booked rapidly\r\nTesting will also be more difficult than usual. First\r\nthere will be competing demands for tests environments\r\nNew applications like those related to the Euro or\r\nreplacing fractions with decimals in trading activities\r\nwill require testing in current environments. Yet\r\ngiven the importance of these applications and their\r\ninterdependencies with other applications that must\r\nbe tested for Year 2000 compliance, strategies will\r\nhave to be developed for testing in both current and\r\nYear 2000 environments. Test data will need to be\r\n.specially developed\r\nBecause testing is primarily a business line\r\nactivity, business line resources will be under\r\n.heavy pressure\r\nThe Year 2000 is sufficiently complex that it *\r\nshould not be combined with other maintenance or\r\nsortware changes in the application. If problems\r\nare encountered, determining whether the Year 2000\r\nor other changes are causing the problems can\r\nbecome extremely difficult. Many organisations are\r\nfreezing other projects until the Year 2000 is\r\naddressed to minimise difficulties in tracking\r\nproblems although such freezes are probably\r\n.impractical for long periods of time\r\n''\r\nAppendix B\r\nAction plans for Managing the Year 2000 Process\r\nin More Detail\r\nDeveloping a strategic approach\r\nMaking sure that an appropriate strategic approach\r\nis developed by determining how best to achieve\r\nYear 2000 compliance within an institution's\r\norganisational structure represents the first phase\r\nThis phase includes and initial, high-level sizing\r\nof the issue and developing a plan as to how best\r\nintroduce the process throughout the organisation\r\nThis phase often relies heavily on technical staff\r\nknowledge of how information systems and technology\r\nare deployed and how business units are organised\r\nand interact with limited contact with business\r\nline areas. During this initial planning process\r\nparticular attention should be paid to assuring\r\nthat, during the organisational awareness phase\r\nbusiness lines will develop an understanding that\r\nthe Year 2000 issue is not only a technical issue\r\nbut a strategic one for each business line and that\r\nthe business lines have ultimate ownership of the\r\n.issue\r\nCreating organisational awareness\r\nMaking certain that the strategic importance of *\r\nthe Year 2000 as a business objective is understood\r\nand appreciated throughout the organisation may be\r\nthe most important phase in the action plan. This\r\nphase has four objectives: creating visibility\r\nensuring commitment, identifying resources, and\r\nformulating specific strategic objectives at a\r\n.business line level\r\nCreating visibility throughoutn the business *\r\norganisation is essential. Everyone must be aware\r\nof the potential problems posed by the date issue\r\nand become sensitive to applications where it might\r\nbe an issue. Only in this way will all local\r\n.applications be identified and addressed appropriately\r\nThe recognition that the Year 2000 may be a *\r\nsurvival issue requires a commitment from top management\r\n.for its successful resolution as a strategic priority\r\nSenior management and directors need to understand\r\nthe issue and its implications ans monitor progress\r\non a regular basis. Specific responsibility for\r\n.managing the issue should be clearly assigned\r\nFor larger organisations a project office focused\r\nsolely on the Year 2000 issue is recommended\r\nPartnerships between technical staff and business\r\nlines must be developed with the business line\r\nmanagers accepting ultimate accountability to\r\n.address the issue successfully\r\n''\r\nResource estimates need to be determined and built *\r\ninto budgets. Business lines need to recognise that\r\ntesting will be the single most important resource\r\nintensive part of the project and that responsibility\r\nfor designing test plans and carrying out the tests\r\nrest with the business. Senior management must\r\nthat becoming Year 2000 compliant can rarely be\r\nachieved as part of normal business operations and\r\nbudgets. All applications throughout the bank must\r\nbe addressed but some level of required maintenance\r\n.and new product development must typically proceed\r\nStrategic decisions must be made at this stage *\r\nbecause technology and business line resources will\r\nhave to be redeployed. Opportunities exist to\r\n.repair, replace, outsource or eliminate applications\r\nSenior level guidance on how to make these decisions\r\n.becomes critical\r\nAssessing actions and developing detailed plans\r\nThis phase moves the project from concept to *\r\nconcrete actions. Detailed inventories of what must\r\nbe done are developed covering centralised and\r\ndecentralised hardware, software and networks as\r\nwell as equipment with embedded computer chips and\r\nlogic. Particular care is needed to make sure that\r\napplications developed or procured locally at the\r\n.business line level are included in the inventory\r\nThe inventories should include all aspects of\r\nbusiness line activities whether internal to the\r\norganisation or external to it. Risks should be\r\n.quantified and priorities set based on these risks\r\nInternal partnerships between technical staff and *\r\nbusiness lines should be solidified. The\r\nresponsibilities of each should be clearly defined\r\nand timetables agreed upon. Procedures for monitoring\r\nprogress against schedules should be implemented\r\nwith appropriate information flowing to senior\r\n.management and directors on a regular basis\r\nVendors and service providers should be contacted\r\nas to their status and plans for addressing the\r\nissue and contracts developed where appropriate\r\nUser groups can be helpful in making such contacts\r\nand getting information but are no substitute for\r\nan organisation following through with the information\r\nreceived. Applications must be able to work within\r\nthe bank's own operating environment, and responsibility\r\nfor seeing that appropriate testing is done cannot\r\nbe delegated to vendors or user groups. Making certain\r\nthat current versions of software and operating systems\r\nare in place is particularly important because\r\ncompliant applications may not work properly in a\r\n.dated environment\r\n''\r\nVendor management requires special attention and *\r\nrepresents a continuous challenge throughout\r\nYear 2000 projects. Obtaining meaningful dates\r\nfor product delivery, testing or other milestones\r\nis often particularly difficult as vendors are\r\nconcerned about the legal liability that may be\r\nassociated with representations that prove to be\r\nin error Notwithstanding this difficulty, the\r\ndevelopment of effective communication channels\r\n.with vendors is essential\r\nDuring the assessment phase, one or more *\r\napplications might be made year 2000 compliant\r\non an expedited basis. Such pilots will help\r\nstaff develop a better understanding of the work\r\nthat must be done and permit better plans and\r\nbudgets to be developed. Also automated tools\r\nthat help identify where dates are present should\r\n.be tested as to their effectiveness\r\nThis phase also should include a review of legal *\r\nobligations. In particular, contracts with vendors\r\nand service providers should be reviewed as to\r\nrespective responsibilities of the bank and the\r\nthird party vendor. Insurance policies should be\r\nreviewed to see how Year 2000 problems would be\r\nhandled if problems were to be encountered under\r\n.various scenarios\r\nThe development of detailed plans for the entire *\r\nproject should be the principal end product of the\r\nassessment phase. These plans need to address not\r\nonly the changes that need to be made but also lay\r\nout key milestones, test plans, and communication\r\nchannels. The plans need to deal with internally\r\ndeveloped applications whether centralised or\r\ndecentralised, with service providers and vendors\r\nand with correspondents and customers. Responsibilities\r\nand accountabilities need to be clearly defined for\r\neach step in the plans. The critical path within the\r\noverall plan needs to be determined, recognising\r\nthat there will be many interdependencies that must\r\n.be tested together\r\nRenovating systems, applications and equipment\r\nRenovating systems, applications and equipment is *\r\nthe only phase of the process that is primarily\r\ntechnical. During this phase, the additional resources\r\nneeded for the project should be acquired or\r\ncontracted. Operating systems, applications, hardware\r\nand equipment needing fixing should be modified\r\nreplaced, outsourced or discontinued. Automated\r\ntools and outside consultants probably have a role\r\n.to play in most organisations during this phase\r\n''\r\nIn depth communication with vendors and careful *\r\nmonitoring of their progress occurs during this\r\nphase. In particular, a clear understanding of\r\nwhat the vendor means by being Year 2000 compliant\r\nmust be obtained. This includes detailed knowledge\r\nof any environmental assumptions and planned changes\r\nin communications protocols. Agreement must be\r\nreached regarding the level of assistance the vendor\r\nwill offer if problems are encountered. While a\r\nwarrranty or certification may be sought or offered\r\nthe bank must recognise that such certification will\r\nalmost certainly not cover interfaces with other\r\napplications and that the need for rigorous testing\r\n.is not obviated by such a warranty or certification\r\nIdentifying alternative approaches if renovations *\r\nlag or fail is an important part of this step. Again\r\nsuch contingency plans should deal not only with\r\ninternal renovation work but also address the work\r\nof vendors and service providers as well as\r\ncorrespondents and customers with whom the institution\r\ninterfaces. Contingency plans must include critical\r\nmilestones for measuring progress of critical delivery\r\ndates where decisions must be made to pursue an\r\n.alternative solution if the objective is no met\r\nContingency plans need to take into account the\r\nmission criticality of applications because, in all\r\nlikelihood as the time certain deadline approaches\r\nit will become impossible to fully implement all\r\nchanges for all applications. Contingency plans\r\nneed to recognise that, in some cases, correspondent\r\nrelationships may need to be altered or customer\r\n.relationships severed\r\n''\r\nValidating the renovation through testing\r\nTesting represents the largest single task in the *\r\nYear 2000 project. Detailed test schedules must\r\nbe developed and coordinated with correspondents\r\nand customers, particularly with an ever-decreasing\r\nnumber of weekend testing opportunities available\r\nFull validation requires that Year 2000 data conditions\r\nbe simulated for all elements of the test. Data\r\nflows internally and with third parties must be\r\nthoroughly tested while both the sender and recelver\r\nsimulate Year 2000 conditions. Institutions need to\r\nparticipate in tests with service providers both\r\n.on a bilateral test basis and in multi-user tests\r\nWhich simulate full production volumes. Contingency\r\nplans need to be implemented as needed when\r\n.renovations are completed by specified cut-off dates\r\nDuring this phase, support facilities to assure *\r\nthat new or modified applications run properly are\r\nalso developed. In particular, procedure manuals\r\nare written of rewritten and disseminated, training\r\nprograms provided, and help desks established or\r\n.retrained\r\nImplementing tested, compliant systems\r\nImplementation requires careful planning to make *\r\nsure that interrelated applications are coordinated\r\nas to when they go into production. Coordination\r\nbecomes particularly important when files at\r\ninterfaces are changing in format. While recognising\r\nthat coordination is necessary, putting compliant\r\napplications into production at the earliest possible\r\n.date simplifies future testing\r\nThe implementation phase also requires monitoring *\r\nof progress by service providers and vendors. Service\r\nproviders in particular are likely to have two or\r\nmore versions of an application at any one time in\r\norder to meet the needs of institutions in various\r\n.stages of implementation\r\nThe implementation phase also includes reverting *\r\n.to contingency plans when necessary\r\n''\r\nAppendix C\r\nChecklist for a Successful Year 2000 Program\r\nBuilding a successful Year 2000 program requires\r\nthat a bank address a number of key factors and\r\ntake appropriate steps to address them. These\r\n:factors include\r\nTop management understanding and endorsement *\r\n.as a strategic priority\r\nLine management appreciation that it is not just *\r\na technical issue but potentially one of business\r\n.survival\r\nExplicit assignment of responsibility for the *\r\n.Year 2000 project and empwerment to carry it out\r\nDetailed planning with the recognition that testing *\r\nwill be the most resource intensive part ot the\r\n.process\r\nAppreciation that external testing may be among\r\n.the most difficult parts of the process\r\nRecognition that vendors and service providers *\r\ncannot certify that their products will work\r\nproperly with a bank's own applications, equipment\r\n.and operating environment\r\nProactive communication with external vendors *\r\nand service providers, and correspondents and\r\n.customers\r\nRecognition that correspondents and customers *\r\npose credit and other risks and analysis of the\r\n.risks posed\r\nPrioritisation of applications as to their strategic *\r\n.importance\r\nIdentification of explicit resources to address the *\r\n.Year 2000 issue consistent with business priorities\r\nEstablishment of explicit target dates for milestones\r\n.and regular reports to top management on progress\r\n.Active involvement of audit in the Year 2000 process *\r\nClear contingency plans with trigger dates and *\r\n.procedures for implementation\r\nStrong monitoring of security controls throughout *\r\n.the process\r\n''\r\nطبقا لقرار مصرف لبنان رق 6960 تاريخ 14/5/1998\r\nDISC PD 2000-1 A Definition of Year 2000 Conformity\r\nRequirements\r\nA DEFINITION OF YEAR 2000 CONFORMITY REQUIREMENTS\r\nDISC is a part of the British Standards Institution\r\nWWW. bsi.org.uk\r\nDISC PD 2000-1 A Definition of Year 2000 Conformity\r\nRequirements\r\nA DEFINITION OF YEAR 2000 CONFORMITY REQUIREMENTS\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThis document addresses what is commonly known as\r\nYear 2000 conformity (also sometimes known as\r\ncentury or millenium compliance).

No value for current date will cause any\r\ninterruption in operation\r\nRule 2. Date-based functionality must behave\r\nconsistently for dates prior to during and after\r\n.year 2000\r\nRule 3. In all interfaces and data storage, the\r\ncentury in any date must be specified either\r\nexplicity or by unambiguous algorithms or inferencing\r\n.rules\r\n.Rule 4. Year 2000 must be recognized as a leap year\r\nAMPLIFICATION OF THE DEFINITION AND RULES\r\nGeneral Explanation\r\nProblems can arise from some means of representing\r\ndates in computer equipment and products and from\r\ndate-logic embedded in purchased goods or services\r\nas the year 2000 approaches and during and after\r\nthat year. As a result, equipment or products\r\nincluding embedded control logic, may fail completely\r\n.malfunction or cause data to be corrupted\r\nTo avoid such problems, organizations must check, and\r\nmodify if necessary, internallyh produced equipment\r\nand products and similarly check externally supplied\r\nequipment and products with their suppliers. The\r\npurpose of this document is to allow such checks to\r\n.be made on a basis of common understanding\r\nWhere checks are made with external suppliers, care\r\nshould betaken to distinguish between claims of\r\nconformity and the ability to demonstrate conformity\r\nRule 1\r\n1-1 This rule is sometimes known as general integrity\r\n1-2 If this requirement is satisfied, roll-over\r\nbetween all significant time demarcations (e.g. days\r\nmonths, years, centuries) will be performed correctly\r\n1-3 Current date means today's date as known to the\r\n.equipment or product\r\n''\r\nRule 2\r\n2-1 This rule is sometimes known as date integrity\r\n2-2 This rule means that all equipment and products\r\nmust calculate, manipulate and represent dates\r\ncorrectly for the purposes for which they were\r\n.intended\r\n2-3 The meaning of functionality includes both\r\n.processes and the results of those processes\r\n2-4 If desired, a reference point for date values\r\nand calculations may be added by organizations; e.g\r\n.as defined by the Gregprian calendar\r\n2-5 No equipment or product shall use particular date\r\nvalues for special meanings; e.g. \"99\" to signify\r\nno endvalue\" or \"end of file\" or \"00\" to mean\"\r\n.not applicable\" or \"beginning of file\"\r\nRule 3\r\n3-1 This rule os sometimes known as explicit/implicit\r\n.century\r\n3-2 :It covers two general approaches\r\na) explicit representation of the year in dates)\r\ne.g. by using four digits or by including a century\r\nindicator. In this case, a reference may be\r\ninserted (e.g. 4-digit years as allowed by ISO\r\nstandard 8601:1988) and it may be necessary to\r\nallow for exceptions where domain-specific standards\r\ne.g standards relating to Electronic Data)\r\nInterchange, Automatic Teller Machines or Bankers\r\nAutomated Clearing Services) should have precedence\r\nb) the use of inferencing rules: e.g. two-digit)\r\nyears with a value greater than 50 imply 19xx, those\r\nwith a value equal to or less than 50 imply 20xx\r\nRules for century inferencing as a whole must apply\r\nto all contexts in which the date is used, although\r\ndifferent inferencing rules may apply to different\r\n.date sets\r\nGeneral Notes\r\nFor Rules 1 and 2 in particular, organizations\r\nmay wish to specify allowable ranges for values\r\nof current date and dates to be manipulated. The\r\nranges may relate to one or more of the feasible\r\nlife-span of equipment or products or the span of\r\ndates required to be represented by the organization's\r\nbusiness processes. Tests for specifically critical\r\ndates may also be added (e.g. for leap years, end\r\nofyear, etc). Organizations may wish to append\r\n.additional material in support of local requirements\r\nWhere the term century is used, clear distinction\r\nshould be made between the \"value\" denoting the\r\ncentury (e.g. 20th) and its representation in dates\r\ne.g. 19xx); similarly, 21st and 20xx)\r\nISBN 0 580 29746 2\r\nDISC is a part of the British Standards Institution\r\nCopyright DISC 1995,1996,1997\r\n''\r\nتقرير عن المرحلة الاولى من خطة تلافي مشاكل العام\r\n2000 طبقا لقرار مصرف لبنان رقم 6960 تاريخ 14/5/1998\r\n(يعبأ هذا التقرير ويرسل الى مديرية المعلوماتية في\r\nمصرف لبنان ولجنة الرقابة على المصارف في موعد اقصاه\r\nنهاية شهر اب من العام 1998)\r\nاسم المصرف/المؤسسة: ــــــــــــــ\r\nالتاريخ           : ـــــــــــــــــ\r\nاسماء اعضاء مجموعة العمل او اللجنة المشرفة:\r\nأ- الاستراتيجية ونطاق العمل\r\n1- هل اعتمد المصرف -

Failure to address this issue in a\r\ntimely manner would cause banking institutions to\r\nexperience opperational problems or even bankruptcy\r\nand could cause the disruption of financial markets\r\nAs a result, banking institutions must take the\r\nnecessary steps to ensure that problems and disruptions\r\n. are minimised\r\nThis paper is prepared by the Basle Committee on *\r\nBanking Supervision in order to serve as reference\r\non the Year 2000 issue for central banks and other\r\n:banking supervisors. It contains four parts that\r\ni) put the issue in perspective; (ii) outline the\r\nsteps institutions need to follow to resolve the\r\nproblem; (iii) discuss key issues that need to be\r\naddressed to resolve the problem successfully; and\r\niv) identify how bank supervisors can help assure)\r\nsuccess. A more technical and detailed discussion\r\nof the Year 2000 issue is provided in Appendix A\r\nAppendix B describes the components that go into\r\na successful action plan. Appendix C provides a\r\nshort checklist summarising some of the key factors\r\nthat banks must address to successfully meet the\r\nYear 2000 challenge\r\n''\r\nI. THE YEAR 2000 IN PERSPECTIVE\r\nBanks rely heavily  on automation to manage *\r\ninformation. If automated applications failed to\r\nwork properly, it would be difficult if not\r\nimpossible to conduct business. While the Year 2000\r\nproblem is often seen as a technical issue, it is\r\nmuch more than a technical one because of the\r\nimplications that not dealing with it properly could\r\nhave on each and every business line within the\r\nbank. Every manager must be actively involved in\r\nassuring that the business line is Year 2000 compliant\r\nTop management needs not only to recognise the\r\nstrategic importance of the issue but also to monitor\r\nplans and progress actively across the bank\r\nThe Year 2000 is particularly challenging because\r\nit is not just internal to a bank. Banks have many\r\nautomated linkages and interdependencies with\r\ncorrespondents and customers. For larger banks that\r\ndeal in multiple currencies and provide wide ranges\r\nof products in many countries around the world, the\r\nchallenge is particularly great because many of these\r\napplications are interdependent. If applications are\r\nnot able to work together properly, significant\r\nproblems could develop. All of these interdependencies\r\nmust be addressed and tested to assure that problems\r\nare not present. Similarly, banks rely on third party\r\nservice providers or vendors for many applications\r\nThese applications not only need to be made compliant\r\nbut also must be thoroughly tested within each bank\r\nto assure that perform properly for the particular\r\nenvironment and application interfaces fround in each\r\n.institution\r\n''\r\nComplicating the resolution of the Year 2000 issue\r\non a global basis are the differing situations\r\nfound in many markets and countries around the\r\nworld. The scheduled introduction of the Euro is\r\nplacing significant competing demands on scarce\r\ntechnical resources for institutions active in that\r\nmarket. Other new or modified financial trading or\r\ndelivery systems are being introduced in other\r\nmarkets. In some countries, other policy or business\r\nobjectives may divert technical resources from the\r\n,financial sector. Even within the financial sector\r\nthere are differing priorities for banks, securities\r\nfirms, and insurance companies. These and other\r\nfactors lead to widely varying amounts of attention\r\nbeing devoted to Year 2000 issues by individual\r\n.institutions\r\n,Since the earliest days of electronic computers\r\nprogrammers have used two digits to represent the\r\nyear in date fields (YYMMDD). In the 1960s when this\r\nconvention became standard, the two-digit representation\r\nmade economic sense because it economised computer\r\nmemory and saved storage space. Even in the 1980s, few\r\nbelieved that applications being developed then would\r\nstill be running into the year 2000. Unfortunately\r\nthis belief was ill founded. While many newer\r\napplications are Year 2000 compliant, many older\r\napplications upon which compliant applications depend\r\nor interact continue to run. In addition, the\r\nenvironmental software and hardware on which an\r\napplication runs may not be compliant. Assuming that\r\nany application is Year 2000 compliant without\r\nappropriate analysis and testing poses substantial\r\n.risks\r\n''\r\nThe Year 2000 problem exists because a two-digit *\r\nrepresentation of the year will be interpreted in\r\nmany applications to mean the year 1900, not 2000\r\nunless the date or program, logic is modified. Many\r\ncalculations will either indicate that transactions\r\nhave been open for nearly a hundred years or produce\r\nnegative numbers. New files may not be recognised\r\nas the most recent data, causing current files to\r\nbe erased or archived as old data. These and other\r\nlogic issues have the potential for causing problems\r\nfor debt collection, ageing of information, calculating\r\ninterest rates, etc. and could significantly disrupt\r\nnormal business operations. Also, when dates are\r\ncompared, customer billings may change from charges\r\nto refunds and vice versa. Even building systems\r\nsuch as elevators or climate control systems may\r\nbe affected because of embedded logic to facilitate\r\n.maintenance and operations\r\nAll of these factors make the Year 2000 a formidable *\r\nchallenge, Whether the banking industry has the\r\nability to rise to this challenge and avoid serious\r\npoblems as the date change occurs will be determined\r\nby the actions that individual banks and the banking\r\ncommunity more generally take between now and the\r\nYear 2000. To delay work on the issue runs the risk\r\nthat all of the code modifications, testing and other\r\nchanges cannot be done in a timely manner. Unlike\r\nmost projects involving technology, the time certain\r\nnature of 1999 becoming 2000 makes it impossible to\r\ndelay the event and full implementation of corrective\r\n.actions\r\n''\r\nII- ACTION PLANS FOR MANAGING THE YEAR 2000 PROCESS\r\nAll the indications are that a chieving Year 2000 *\r\ncompliance will be both complex and resource intensive\r\nLimited time exists and extensions are not possible\r\n.because the century date change is a fixed reality\r\nDetailed plans must be developed and resources\r\n.identified and secured to achieve the objective\r\nOrganisations that are not well advanced in their\r\nYear 2000 efforts are going to be particularly\r\nchallenged and will need to move quickly. All\r\nbanking institutions need to assess where they and\r\ntheir correspondents and customers stand and to\r\n.begin thinking about contingency plans\r\nAddressing the Year 2000 requires that every bank *\r\nhave an action plan. The complexity of the plan may\r\nvary from one bank to another depending upon size\r\nand the extent to which an organisation relies on\r\noutside vendors and service providers. However, even\r\nsmall banks with no internally developed applications\r\nmust have a plan for dealing with the vendors and\r\ntheir equipment and systems with embedded chips. While\r\nindividual organisations may have their own ways of\r\ndescribing their plans, one way to look at a good\r\naction plan is to think of it as consisting of the\r\nfollowing phases. The specific actions to be taken\r\n.in each phase are provided in more detail in Appendix B\r\na) Developing a strategic approach)\r\nThis phase includes establishing Year 2000 as a\r\nstrategic objective at the highest levels within the\r\nbank, developing a process to communicate the objective\r\nthroughout the banking organisation, and assessing\r\nthe resource implications of the Year 2000 at a very\r\n.high level\r\nAt this time, organisations should be well past *\r\n.this phase in addressing issues\r\nb) Creating organisational awareness\r\nMaking certain that the strategic importance of *\r\nthe Year 2000 as a business objective is understood\r\nand appreciated throughout the organisation may be\r\nthe most important phase in the action plan. The\r\nrecognition that the Year 2000 may be a survival\r\nissue requires not only a visible commitment from\r\ntop management for its successful resolution as a\r\nstrategic priority but also an awareness of its\r\nimportance by staff at all levels. Line management\r\nneeds to understand the issue and its implications\r\nand accept ownership of the issue. Responsibilities\r\nshould be clearly assigned. This phase have four\r\nobjectives: creating visibility; ensuring commitment\r\nidentifying resources; and specifying specific\r\n.strategic objectives at a business line level\r\nOrganisations should also be past this phase in *\r\n.their Year 2000 project\r\n''\r\nc) Assessing actions and developing detailed plans)\r\nThis phase moves the project from concept to *\r\nconcrete actions. Detailed inventories of what must\r\nbe done are developed, covering centralised and\r\ndecentralised hardware, software, and nerworks as\r\nwell as equipment with embedded computer chips and\r\nlogic. The inventories should include all aspects\r\nof business line activities whether internal to the\r\nbank or external to it. Risks should be quantified\r\n.and priorities set based on these risks\r\nWhile target dates for finishing this phase may *\r\nvary from one country to another, organisations are\r\nexpected to have completed this phase or be very\r\nclose to completing it by September 1997 in many\r\n.countries\r\nd) Renovating systems, applications and equipment\r\nThis is the only phase of the process that is *\r\nprimarily technical. During this phase, the necessary\r\nfixing of operating systems, applications, hardware\r\nand equipment takes place. The development of\r\ncontingency plans that identify alternative approaches\r\nif renovations lag or fail is an important part of\r\n.this phase\r\nOrganisations should be well into this phase at *\r\nthis time. Renovation work for significant\r\napplications that need to be tested with third\r\nparties must be completed with enough time to\r\nallow for thorough testing. In countries where\r\nYear 2000 preparations are well in hand, completion\r\nof this high priority work is being targeted for\r\nmid-1998. These countries also typically target\r\nthat all renovation work be completed no later\r\n.than the end of 1998\r\ne) Validating the renovation through testing)\r\nTesting represents the largest single task in the *\r\nYear 2000 project. Detailed test shedules must be\r\ndeveloped and coordinated with correspondents\r\nand customers. Data flows, internally and with\r\nthird parties must be thoroughly tested while both\r\n.the sender and receiver simulate Year 2000 conditions\r\nIn countries where Year 2000 preparations are well *\r\nin hand, for at least larger institutions and all\r\nsignificant applications, the validation phase is\r\nbeing targeted for completion by the end of 1998\r\nAll validation work should be completed by mid 1999\r\nOnly with this schedule will there be sufficient\r\ntime for industry and business wide testing with\r\n.all correspondents and customers during 1999\r\nf) Implementing tested, compliant systems)\r\nImplementation requires careful planning to make *\r\nsure that interrelated applications are coordinated\r\nas to when they go into production. The implementation\r\nphase also requires monitoring of progress by service\r\n.providers and vendors\r\n''\r\nIII. ISSUES\r\nAddressing the Year 2000 represents a major and *\r\ncomplex issue to manage. As organisations have\r\ndeveloped their detailed plans, a group of issues\r\n.have surfaced that deserve particular attention\r\nWhile several of these issues have been discussed\r\n,in describing the challenge and its management\r\nthey are highlighted in more detail here because\r\nof frequent misunderstandings or inadequate\r\n.attention\r\nCertification\r\nCertification has been a recurring and confusing *\r\nissue for many institutions. Many institutions and\r\nespecially smaller institutions believe that if a\r\nvendor certifies a particular product as being\r\n.Year 2000 compliant, they need not worry about it\r\nThere are two fallacies to this idea. First, some\r\nvendors indicate that their product is compliant\r\nwhen in fact it is not. Second, even of the product\r\nis compliant, it still must be tested by the\r\ninstitution to make sure that it runs properly within\r\nthe institution's own environment and interfaces\r\nproperly with other applications. At least some\r\nlevel of testing by the business line area will be\r\n.required to assure true compliance\r\nVendor management\r\nThird party vendors pose special risks because *\r\nthe amount of oversight and control that an\r\nindividual bank can influence is limited. As a\r\nresult, banks need to have a clear understanding\r\nof vendor plans and hold vendors accountable. If\r\nkey targets are not met, contingency plans should\r\nbe in place to change vendors, complete work\r\n.internally, or otherwise adjust to vendor failure\r\nTarget dates\r\nTarget dates for testing are critical both *\r\ninternally and externally. Most institutions have\r\nbeen developing target dates for testing for\r\ninternal use but have not been active in communicating\r\nthese dates to correspondents and customers. Because\r\nmeaningful testing often requires testing internally\r\nand with external parties. The coordination of test\r\nplans with correspondents and large, active customers\r\nbecome very important to the institution. Indeed\r\nsetting priorities and internal target dates will\r\ndepent to some extent on whem external testing\r\nbecomes feasible. Especially for larger institutions\r\npayment systems, clearance and settlement systems\r\nand similar utilities, communicating test plans for\r\napplications having external interfaces becomes\r\n.crucial for the industry-wide planning process\r\nFor institution that may be somewhat lagging in *\r\ntheir Year 2000 efforts to date, the need to\r\ncommunicate meaningful target dates for testing\r\nposes a dilemma. Not communicating readiness dates\r\nfor external testing now or indicating a date that is\r\ntoo far out in the future sends immediate\r\nindications to the financial community that the\r\ninstitution may be lagging in Year 2000 efforts. On\r\nthe other hand, communication a target date that\r\nappears acceptable but which might not be met runs\r\nthe risk of having credibility questioned even more\r\nseverely if the target is missed. Even internally\r\nas institutions think about setting target dates\r\nfor testing or other project milestones, they need\r\nto recognise that the century date change is\r\ninevitable. Setting optimistic targets that barely\r\nmake compliance possible may be only diguising the\r\n.real problem and issue for the organisation\r\n''\r\nSpillover business risks\r\nSpillover business risks and opportunities *\r\nrepresent and area that is often overlooked when\r\ndeveloping Year 200 plans. Typically, institutions\r\nfocus first on the internal efforts necessary to\r\nbecome compliant. Yet, the Year 2000 issue can also\r\nbe a survival issue for customers. Failure of\r\ncustomers to make the necessary adjustments can lead\r\nto a loss of business and loss of asset values for\r\nthe bank. On the other hand, having a strong Year 2000\r\nprogram may open strategic opportunities to market\r\nthe readiness posture of the institution. In any\r\nevent, credit and relationship officers should\r\nalready be cognisant of their customer's readiness\r\ntracking progress over time, estimating possible\r\nbusiness ramifications if customers fail to become\r\ncompliant, and developing contingency plans as\r\n.appropriate\r\nMergers and acquisitions\r\nMergers and acquisitions represent another area *\r\nwhere Year 2000 readiness should be taken into\r\naccount because such activity would place additional\r\nburden on scarce technical and managerial resources\r\nof the organisations. At minimum, a rigorous due\r\ndiligence on Year 2000 prepardness should be\r\nconducted in order to assess the status of the\r\ninstitutions would affect Year 2000 plans, actions\r\nand ultimately readiness. For organisations that\r\nare strtched in meeting Year 2000 compliance\r\nacquiring another institution would be highly risky\r\nIndeed, the possibility of being acquired might\r\nbe an approach to contingency planning. However\r\nas time passes, there is decreasing ability for\r\nany organisation to absorb a non-compliant one\r\nand make the necessary changes before the century\r\n.date change\r\nSatellite operations and foreign activities\r\nSatellite operations and foreign activities pose *\r\na significant risk for many institutions, While\r\ninventorying mainframe and other applications\r\nunder the control of a centralised information\r\nsystems management may be relatively easy, departmental\r\napplications unknown to the centralised operations\r\nare increasingly common. Many of these applications\r\nare essential risk monitoring and business decision\r\ntools. Extra effort is needed to identify these\r\napplications and make certain that they are compliant\r\nMaking business line staff at all levels aware of\r\nthe Year 2000 issue is essential if problems are\r\n.to be avoided\r\nSimilarly, foreign and decentralised operations *\r\nfrequently have applications specific to the local\r\nmarket trading activity or the local currency. Staff\r\nin these locations are often not as aware of corporate\r\nissues like the Year 2000 as staff would be at the\r\nhead office. As a result, the likelihood increases\r\nthat applications-potentially significant ones-would\r\nnot be picked up in the inventory or appropriately\r\n.addressed\r\n''\r\nSecurity issues\r\nSecurity issues arise and will become more pressing *\r\nas the urgency of the Year 2000 increase. Normally\r\nsound security controls may be relaxed as consultants\r\nand subcontractors for consultants undergo less\r\nrigorous background checks before being granted\r\naccess to bank systems and records. Date dependent\r\nsecurity applications may be turned off to facilitate\r\ntesting. As businesses focus more on resolving\r\ninterconnectivity concerns, resources normally\r\n.focused on security controls may be diverted\r\nCost control\r\nCost control represents a problem area for many *\r\ninstitutions. In particular, the adequacy of budgets\r\nbecomes an issue. Many organisations appear to be\r\nunderestimating he costs of testing by not recognising\r\nthat many tests will have to be performed multiple\r\ntimes as vendors change releases or operating system\r\nenvironments or applications change. Additionally\r\nbusiness line management often fails to recognise\r\nthat the largest share of the testing burden will\r\n.ultimately fall to them\r\nTechnical resource sarcities are also getting *\r\nworse with the passage of time. Institutions are\r\nalready experiencing significant turnover of key\r\nstaff as salaries are bid up ever higher in the\r\nmarket. Bonuses and special retention packages\r\nare being used in many institutions to address the\r\n.turnover issue\r\nOutside consultants are facing similar demands *\r\nresulting in higher costs. Here however, the issue\r\nis not just cost but the quality (skill and\r\nintegrity of the consultant and the level of\r\nconfidence one can have that the consultant will\r\ncontinue to exist if problems are encountered. As\r\na result of all of these factors, many organisations\r\nare finding it necessary to increase budget estimates\r\n.sometimes several times and often significantly\r\nMonitoring\r\nMonitoring Year 2000 progress should be a high *\r\npriority for every institution. The role that the\r\nadult function plays in the monitoring process\r\nshould be clearly defined, proactive, and clearly\r\nvisible at the highest levels. Follow up on audit\r\nexceptions should be tracked carefully and on a\r\ntimely basis. Control mechanisms need to be developed\r\nspecifically for monitoring Year 2000 progress\r\nand senior management and directors need to be\r\nmonitoring progress on a regular basis as one of\r\n.the highest priorities of the institution\r\n''\r\nPotential systemic issues\r\nPotential systemic issues need to be identified *\r\nThe Year 2000 issue is not one that will present\r\nproblems only to those who fail to rise to the\r\n\" challenge. For large banks and industry \"utilities\r\nthat serve the entire banking community by offering\r\nservices or products not readily available elsewhere\r\nproblems focused in a single location could rapidy\r\n.affect others if payments fail to move as expected\r\nPotential weak links in the payment chain need to\r\nbe identified as early as possible with appropriate\r\n.contingency plans developed and followed as necessary\r\nCredit issues with sustemic implications can also\r\narise if very large customers or classes of customers\r\nbecome unable to conduct business. Obligations may\r\nnot be met and collateral values can deteriorate\r\nrapidly. While the sustemic implications of Year 2000\r\ncredit issues may take somewhat longer to manifest\r\n.themselves, they are nonetheless real\r\nOutside ouditors and public reports\r\nOutside auditors and public reports are likely to *\r\nbecome an issue at the end of the current fiscal\r\nyear for some organisations. In some countries\r\nlike the United States, the decision has already\r\nbeen made that Year 2000 renovation costs must be\r\n.accounted for in the year in which they are incurred\r\nWhile the accounting profession is still debating\r\nwhether such costs will have to be disclosed as a\r\nspecific item, there is building consensus that\r\norganisations appearing to be unable to be Year 2000\r\ncompliant for material businesses or applications\r\nwill have to have this risk specifically noted in\r\ncertified statements. At what point such disclosure\r\n.begins to be required remains uncertain\r\nIV. ROLE FOR BANK SUPERVISORS\r\nBank supervisors clearly cannot solve the Year 2000 *\r\nchallenge; only institutions can do that for\r\nthemselves. However, bank supervisors can play a\r\n.constructive role in a number of ways\r\n''\r\nPromoting increased awareness\r\nPromoting increased awareness of the issue is *\r\nprobably both the simplest and most effective\r\nrole that bank supervisors can play. Identifying\r\nthe seriousness of the problem through alerts\r\nor other public notices that are carefully balanced\r\nand factual has been used successfully in a number\r\nof countries. In some cases, these public notices\r\nhave included helpful guidance on low institutions\r\nmight effectively address the issue. Direct contact\r\nwith industry groups or individual institutions\r\ncan also be used to increase the awareness of senior\r\n.management\r\nEstablishing targets and benchmarks for the industry\r\nEstablishing targets and benchmarks for the *\r\nindustry is another way to help assure progress. While\r\ndifferent market circumstances may suggest that such\r\ntargets will differ from country to country, having\r\nclear expectations helps institutions develop their\r\nown plans and furthers opportunities for external\r\ntest plans. Several countries have already offered\r\n.such benchmarks for their institutions\r\nIndustry-wide status assessments\r\nIndustry-wide status assessments on progress can *\r\nalso be helpful. Bank supervisors are uniquely\r\npositioned to know the status of progress in each\r\ninstitution. If issues develop in particular\r\n,locations or with particular types of entities\r\njudicious public observations on the general level\r\nof progress may encourage the reallocation of\r\n.resources to Year 2000 projects in these sectors\r\nProactive supervisory pressures\r\nProactive supervisory pressures directed at *\r\nspecific problems and institutions is the strongest\r\ntool available to bank supervisors. While banks\r\nare the only ones that can make their applications\r\ncompliant, supervisors can heighten the level of\r\nattention Year 2000 issues are receiving within\r\nthe bank through a variety of supervisory tools. If\r\ndespite all efforts of the supervisors, a bank or\r\ngroup of banks are going to have significant\r\nproblems, the supervisors should consider what\r\ncontingency plans are needed to deal with the\r\n.consequences\r\nV. SUMMARY\r\nThe Year 2000 issue is potentially the biggest *\r\n.challenge ever faced by the financial industry\r\nEvery automated system including equipment with\r\ncomputer chips embedded inside is potentially at\r\nrisk and must be analysed and renovated or replaced\r\nif needed. Unlike most automation projects that\r\ncan be staggered as to schedule and delayed if\r\nproblems are encountered, all critical renovations\r\nmust be addressed at once with no possibility for\r\nextending roll out deadlines. If resources and\r\ntime prevent some non-critical applications from\r\nbeing renovated, the implications of such deferrals\r\nshould be thoroughly analysed. As individual\r\napplications are addressed, they will have to be\r\ntested. In an age with extensive linkages among\r\napplications and interconnectivity among institutions\r\nthe testing process is enormous because tests must\r\nbe done repeatedly as new components become compliant\r\nInstitutions that are not already addressing the\r\nYear 2000 date change as a strategic priority need\r\n.to focus on this challenge immediately\r\n''\r\nSeptember 1997\r\nAppendix A\r\nThe Year 2000 Challenge in more detail\r\nOrigin and Impact\r\nSince the earliest days of electronic computers *\r\nprogrammers have used two digits to represent the\r\nyear in date fields (YYMMDD). While many newer\r\napplications are Year 2000 compliant, many older\r\napplications upon which compliant applications\r\ndepend or interact continue to run. Assuming that\r\nany application is Year 2000 compliant without\r\nappropriate analysis and testing poses subtantial\r\n.risks\r\nFurther complexities to the issue are introduced *\r\nby other comsiderations such as the use of reserved\r\nvalues such as using 99 in the year field to indicate\r\nthat a file should be saved forever, archived, or\r\ntreated differently in some way. Even before 2000\r\nis reached, some applications will start behaving\r\nbadly as, in this example, records for the year 1999\r\nwill be treated as special files and handled other\r\nthan normally. Finally, all programs will need to\r\nbe checked to see that leap year is properly handled\r\n.in 2000\r\nThere is no single way of fixing existing *\r\napplications or databases. Two of the most common\r\napproaches are to add two digits to the year field\r\nCCYYMMDD) or a technique called windowing, which)\r\nanalyses the two digit year field and automatically\r\nrecognises years under a specified number (say 60\r\nas being 20yy while years over the number are\r\nrecognised as being 19yy. Other fixes are also\r\nappropriate as permanent or temporary measures to\r\n.address particular applications\r\n:Applications affect all areas of the business *\r\nthe front office, the middle and back offices, the\r\ncustomer delivery system, and management information\r\nand decision support systems. Because applications\r\nare frequently interdependent on each other, all\r\ninterdependencies must be identified and thoroughly\r\ntested every time one element in the chain is\r\n.modified\r\n.Making the appropriate changes is complex *\r\n.Different situations require different solutions\r\nAdding two digits affects the amount of memory\r\nand storage space needed and can affect performance\r\nwith larger records to process. Windowing requires\r\nadded calculations whenever a date is encountered\r\nand can affect performance. Either approach can\r\n.affect how one application interacts with another\r\nFor example, if a four-digit representation for\r\nthe year is chosen, linking applications that expect\r\nto receive only two digits will require further\r\nmodifications to assure correct communication. Every\r\ntime an application is modified to be Year 2000\r\ncompliant, it will have to be tested against every\r\nother application with which there are linkages\r\nSuch testing has to be done not only internally\r\nbut also with correspondents and customers to\r\nassure that interdependencies work properly. Because\r\ncompliant applications become ready to be implemented\r\non a sequential basis, testing will be an ongoing\r\n.and repetitive process\r\n''\r\nAreas Affected\r\nThe potential for Year 2000 problems pervades *\r\nvirtually every area of an institution. Applications\r\nrelying on dates are clearly vulnerable. However\r\nmany applications that do not appear to rely on\r\ndates use dates in ways that are often not apparent\r\nto the user such as in file naming conventions or\r\nwhere the date is part of a key. Wherever dates\r\nare used, they must be indentified, checked for\r\nbeing compliant and addressed by appropriate change\r\n.when necessary\r\nAll applications are vulnerable regardless of *\r\n.whether they are developed internally or externally\r\nApplications developed by third parties may be\r\nespecially vulnerable because reliance must be\r\n.placed on semeone else to make the necessary changes\r\nAfter changes are made, a bank must test the\r\napplication to see that it works properly in its\r\nunique environment. Testing is essential because\r\nvendor applications almost always require current\r\nor at least recent releases for operating systems\r\nor utilities upon which the application depends. If\r\na bank is not current in its version control, compliant\r\n.applications may fail\r\nComputer operating systems are vulnerable because *\r\ndates play a crucial role in file maintenance and\r\nperformance optimisation routines that are invisible\r\nto the user. Access control and security systems are\r\naffected and could lock out users both logically\r\nfrom automated applications and physically from\r\n.buildings or departmental areas\r\nHardware is also affected. Mainframes are particularly\r\nvulnerable as individual components may be of widely\r\ndifferent vintages and a single non-compliant\r\n-component could affect the entire system. Mini\r\ncomputers and PCs may also be affected. ATM machines\r\nor communications equipment have built in dating\r\nfeatures that must be identified, tested, and\r\n.corrected where necessary\r\nInternal communications networks and public *\r\n.carriers have many date sensitive components\r\nAssuring that all problems are identified and made\r\ncompliant requires carefully designed tests involving\r\n.both applications and the network/carrier\r\nEnvironmental and other systems (heating and cooling\r\nsystems, elevators, vauts, facsimile machines, etc\r\nalso may have both date sensitive software and\r\nhardware with embedded computer chips that may\r\n.have hidden date sensitive elements\r\n''\r\nRisks and costs\r\nSignificant risks exist in not making all *\r\n.necessary changes and thoroughly testing systems\r\nOperational risks are obfious. Failure to have\r\nfully operational automated systems can prevent\r\neven simple business functions from being completed\r\nbecause manual or other alternatives may not be\r\nfeasible if processing volumes are sizeable or\r\n.information exchanges are extensive\r\nAny operational problems immediately become *\r\nreputational and legal risks as correspondents\r\nand clients react to business problems. If\r\nsignificant banks face problems, the systemic\r\nimplications could be extensive. Consulants\r\nestimate that legal costs alone could be in the\r\nhundreds of billions of dollars if problems are\r\nextensive in the industry. Such estimates clearly\r\nsuggest the magnitude of the strategic risk faced\r\n.by a bank and the industry more generally\r\nBecause correspondents and customers are also *\r\nsubject to the Year 2000 issue, they too must make\r\nthe necessary changes to conduct business normally\r\nTesting normal connectivity and message transfers\r\nwith correspondents and customers is essential but\r\nnot enough. If they have not also made the necessary\r\nadjustments to their own systems, they could pose\r\ncredit and liquidity risks to the bank. Credit\r\nofficers need to understand the Year 2000 risks\r\nfaced by their customers and how well their customers\r\nare managing these risks. Current financial\r\nperformance will not be an indication of future\r\nperformance for organisations that have not developed\r\nsound plans and provided for appropriate resources\r\n.to carry them out\r\nThe costs that the banking industry will need to *\r\nincur to address the Year 2000 are extensive. The\r\nGarther Group has publicly estimated that it will\r\ncost between US$ 300-US$ 600 billion worldwide\r\njust to complete needed changes and testing. Every\r\nline of code in every program needs to be reviewed\r\nat costs typically estimated at about US$ 1 per\r\nline. Costs for global banks are frequently estimated\r\nin the hundreds of millions of dollars. Smaller\r\nbanks with few in-house developed applications will\r\nstill incur substantial costs to test thoroughly\r\n.applications modified by others\r\nSkilled technical resources are already scare *\r\nand will become even more scarce as the deadline\r\napproaches. Already salaries for certain specialists\r\nare rising and key staff are being bid away by other\r\ncompanies. Consultants with top reputations are\r\nheavily committed, and new clients are accepted\r\nonly on a very selective basis. As time passes\r\nbanks will be forced to turn to consultants with\r\nlittle or no demonstrated performance record and\r\n.uncertain futures\r\n''\r\n.Test facilities also can pose a challenge *\r\nEstablishing a test environment for live testing\r\nusing dates in the year 2000 is not easily done. If\r\n.possible, dedicated systems should be used\r\nAlternatively, a production system might be shut\r\ndown and re-established for the Year 2000 testing\r\nbut such an approach can pose significant risks\r\nbecause moving an advanced date backwards (i.e\r\nfrom 20xx to 19xx) for the operating system is\r\noften a difficult and time consuming process. Also\r\nthe number of weekends and holidays available to\r\nconduct testing is constantly shrinking. Renting\r\ncomputer time from, third parties service providers\r\nmay be possible but, like consultants, their resources\r\n.are being booked rapidly\r\nTesting will also be more difficult than usual. First\r\nthere will be competing demands for tests environments\r\nNew applications like those related to the Euro or\r\nreplacing fractions with decimals in trading activities\r\nwill require testing in current environments. Yet\r\ngiven the importance of these applications and their\r\ninterdependencies with other applications that must\r\nbe tested for Year 2000 compliance, strategies will\r\nhave to be developed for testing in both current and\r\nYear 2000 environments. Test data will need to be\r\n.specially developed\r\nBecause testing is primarily a business line\r\nactivity, business line resources will be under\r\n.heavy pressure\r\nThe Year 2000 is sufficiently complex that it *\r\nshould not be combined with other maintenance or\r\nsortware changes in the application. If problems\r\nare encountered, determining whether the Year 2000\r\nor other changes are causing the problems can\r\nbecome extremely difficult. Many organisations are\r\nfreezing other projects until the Year 2000 is\r\naddressed to minimise difficulties in tracking\r\nproblems although such freezes are probably\r\n.impractical for long periods of time\r\n''\r\nAppendix B\r\nAction plans for Managing the Year 2000 Process\r\nin More Detail\r\nDeveloping a strategic approach\r\nMaking sure that an appropriate strategic approach\r\nis developed by determining how best to achieve\r\nYear 2000 compliance within an institution's\r\norganisational structure represents the first phase\r\nThis phase includes and initial, high-level sizing\r\nof the issue and developing a plan as to how best\r\nintroduce the process throughout the organisation\r\nThis phase often relies heavily on technical staff\r\nknowledge of how information systems and technology\r\nare deployed and how business units are organised\r\nand interact with limited contact with business\r\nline areas. During this initial planning process\r\nparticular attention should be paid to assuring\r\nthat, during the organisational awareness phase\r\nbusiness lines will develop an understanding that\r\nthe Year 2000 issue is not only a technical issue\r\nbut a strategic one for each business line and that\r\nthe business lines have ultimate ownership of the\r\n.issue\r\nCreating organisational awareness\r\nMaking certain that the strategic importance of *\r\nthe Year 2000 as a business objective is understood\r\nand appreciated throughout the organisation may be\r\nthe most important phase in the action plan. This\r\nphase has four objectives: creating visibility\r\nensuring commitment, identifying resources, and\r\nformulating specific strategic objectives at a\r\n.business line level\r\nCreating visibility throughoutn the business *\r\norganisation is essential. Everyone must be aware\r\nof the potential problems posed by the date issue\r\nand become sensitive to applications where it might\r\nbe an issue. Only in this way will all local\r\n.applications be identified and addressed appropriately\r\nThe recognition that the Year 2000 may be a *\r\nsurvival issue requires a commitment from top management\r\n.for its successful resolution as a strategic priority\r\nSenior management and directors need to understand\r\nthe issue and its implications ans monitor progress\r\non a regular basis. Specific responsibility for\r\n.managing the issue should be clearly assigned\r\nFor larger organisations a project office focused\r\nsolely on the Year 2000 issue is recommended\r\nPartnerships between technical staff and business\r\nlines must be developed with the business line\r\nmanagers accepting ultimate accountability to\r\n.address the issue successfully\r\n''\r\nResource estimates need to be determined and built *\r\ninto budgets. Business lines need to recognise that\r\ntesting will be the single most important resource\r\nintensive part of the project and that responsibility\r\nfor designing test plans and carrying out the tests\r\nrest with the business. Senior management must\r\nthat becoming Year 2000 compliant can rarely be\r\nachieved as part of normal business operations and\r\nbudgets. All applications throughout the bank must\r\nbe addressed but some level of required maintenance\r\n.and new product development must typically proceed\r\nStrategic decisions must be made at this stage *\r\nbecause technology and business line resources will\r\nhave to be redeployed. Opportunities exist to\r\n.repair, replace, outsource or eliminate applications\r\nSenior level guidance on how to make these decisions\r\n.becomes critical\r\nAssessing actions and developing detailed plans\r\nThis phase moves the project from concept to *\r\nconcrete actions. Detailed inventories of what must\r\nbe done are developed covering centralised and\r\ndecentralised hardware, software and networks as\r\nwell as equipment with embedded computer chips and\r\nlogic. Particular care is needed to make sure that\r\napplications developed or procured locally at the\r\n.business line level are included in the inventory\r\nThe inventories should include all aspects of\r\nbusiness line activities whether internal to the\r\norganisation or external to it. Risks should be\r\n.quantified and priorities set based on these risks\r\nInternal partnerships between technical staff and *\r\nbusiness lines should be solidified. The\r\nresponsibilities of each should be clearly defined\r\nand timetables agreed upon. Procedures for monitoring\r\nprogress against schedules should be implemented\r\nwith appropriate information flowing to senior\r\n.management and directors on a regular basis\r\nVendors and service providers should be contacted\r\nas to their status and plans for addressing the\r\nissue and contracts developed where appropriate\r\nUser groups can be helpful in making such contacts\r\nand getting information but are no substitute for\r\nan organisation following through with the information\r\nreceived. Applications must be able to work within\r\nthe bank's own operating environment, and responsibility\r\nfor seeing that appropriate testing is done cannot\r\nbe delegated to vendors or user groups. Making certain\r\nthat current versions of software and operating systems\r\nare in place is particularly important because\r\ncompliant applications may not work properly in a\r\n.dated environment\r\n''\r\nVendor management requires special attention and *\r\nrepresents a continuous challenge throughout\r\nYear 2000 projects. Obtaining meaningful dates\r\nfor product delivery, testing or other milestones\r\nis often particularly difficult as vendors are\r\nconcerned about the legal liability that may be\r\nassociated with representations that prove to be\r\nin error Notwithstanding this difficulty, the\r\ndevelopment of effective communication channels\r\n.with vendors is essential\r\nDuring the assessment phase, one or more *\r\napplications might be made year 2000 compliant\r\non an expedited basis. Such pilots will help\r\nstaff develop a better understanding of the work\r\nthat must be done and permit better plans and\r\nbudgets to be developed. Also automated tools\r\nthat help identify where dates are present should\r\n.be tested as to their effectiveness\r\nThis phase also should include a review of legal *\r\nobligations. In particular, contracts with vendors\r\nand service providers should be reviewed as to\r\nrespective responsibilities of the bank and the\r\nthird party vendor. Insurance policies should be\r\nreviewed to see how Year 2000 problems would be\r\nhandled if problems were to be encountered under\r\n.various scenarios\r\nThe development of detailed plans for the entire *\r\nproject should be the principal end product of the\r\nassessment phase. These plans need to address not\r\nonly the changes that need to be made but also lay\r\nout key milestones, test plans, and communication\r\nchannels. The plans need to deal with internally\r\ndeveloped applications whether centralised or\r\ndecentralised, with service providers and vendors\r\nand with correspondents and customers. Responsibilities\r\nand accountabilities need to be clearly defined for\r\neach step in the plans. The critical path within the\r\noverall plan needs to be determined, recognising\r\nthat there will be many interdependencies that must\r\n.be tested together\r\nRenovating systems, applications and equipment\r\nRenovating systems, applications and equipment is *\r\nthe only phase of the process that is primarily\r\ntechnical. During this phase, the additional resources\r\nneeded for the project should be acquired or\r\ncontracted. Operating systems, applications, hardware\r\nand equipment needing fixing should be modified\r\nreplaced, outsourced or discontinued. Automated\r\ntools and outside consultants probably have a role\r\n.to play in most organisations during this phase\r\n''\r\nIn depth communication with vendors and careful *\r\nmonitoring of their progress occurs during this\r\nphase. In particular, a clear understanding of\r\nwhat the vendor means by being Year 2000 compliant\r\nmust be obtained. This includes detailed knowledge\r\nof any environmental assumptions and planned changes\r\nin communications protocols. Agreement must be\r\nreached regarding the level of assistance the vendor\r\nwill offer if problems are encountered. While a\r\nwarrranty or certification may be sought or offered\r\nthe bank must recognise that such certification will\r\nalmost certainly not cover interfaces with other\r\napplications and that the need for rigorous testing\r\n.is not obviated by such a warranty or certification\r\nIdentifying alternative approaches if renovations *\r\nlag or fail is an important part of this step. Again\r\nsuch contingency plans should deal not only with\r\ninternal renovation work but also address the work\r\nof vendors and service providers as well as\r\ncorrespondents and customers with whom the institution\r\ninterfaces. Contingency plans must include critical\r\nmilestones for measuring progress of critical delivery\r\ndates where decisions must be made to pursue an\r\n.alternative solution if the objective is no met\r\nContingency plans need to take into account the\r\nmission criticality of applications because, in all\r\nlikelihood as the time certain deadline approaches\r\nit will become impossible to fully implement all\r\nchanges for all applications. Contingency plans\r\nneed to recognise that, in some cases, correspondent\r\nrelationships may need to be altered or customer\r\n.relationships severed\r\n''\r\nValidating the renovation through testing\r\nTesting represents the largest single task in the *\r\nYear 2000 project. Detailed test schedules must\r\nbe developed and coordinated with correspondents\r\nand customers, particularly with an ever-decreasing\r\nnumber of weekend testing opportunities available\r\nFull validation requires that Year 2000 data conditions\r\nbe simulated for all elements of the test. Data\r\nflows internally and with third parties must be\r\nthoroughly tested while both the sender and recelver\r\nsimulate Year 2000 conditions. Institutions need to\r\nparticipate in tests with service providers both\r\n.on a bilateral test basis and in multi-user tests\r\nWhich simulate full production volumes. Contingency\r\nplans need to be implemented as needed when\r\n.renovations are completed by specified cut-off dates\r\nDuring this phase, support facilities to assure *\r\nthat new or modified applications run properly are\r\nalso developed. In particular, procedure manuals\r\nare written of rewritten and disseminated, training\r\nprograms provided, and help desks established or\r\n.retrained\r\nImplementing tested, compliant systems\r\nImplementation requires careful planning to make *\r\nsure that interrelated applications are coordinated\r\nas to when they go into production. Coordination\r\nbecomes particularly important when files at\r\ninterfaces are changing in format. While recognising\r\nthat coordination is necessary, putting compliant\r\napplications into production at the earliest possible\r\n.date simplifies future testing\r\nThe implementation phase also requires monitoring *\r\nof progress by service providers and vendors. Service\r\nproviders in particular are likely to have two or\r\nmore versions of an application at any one time in\r\norder to meet the needs of institutions in various\r\n.stages of implementation\r\nThe implementation phase also includes reverting *\r\n.to contingency plans when necessary\r\n''\r\nAppendix C\r\nChecklist for a Successful Year 2000 Program\r\nBuilding a successful Year 2000 program requires\r\nthat a bank address a number of key factors and\r\ntake appropriate steps to address them. These\r\n:factors include\r\nTop management understanding and endorsement *\r\n.as a strategic priority\r\nLine management appreciation that it is not just *\r\na technical issue but potentially one of business\r\n.survival\r\nExplicit assignment of responsibility for the *\r\n.Year 2000 project and empwerment to carry it out\r\nDetailed planning with the recognition that testing *\r\nwill be the most resource intensive part ot the\r\n.process\r\nAppreciation that external testing may be among\r\n.the most difficult parts of the process\r\nRecognition that vendors and service providers *\r\ncannot certify that their products will work\r\nproperly with a bank's own applications, equipment\r\n.and operating environment\r\nProactive communication with external vendors *\r\nand service providers, and correspondents and\r\n.customers\r\nRecognition that correspondents and customers *\r\npose credit and other risks and analysis of the\r\n.risks posed\r\nPrioritisation of applications as to their strategic *\r\n.importance\r\nIdentification of explicit resources to address the *\r\n.Year 2000 issue consistent with business priorities\r\nEstablishment of explicit target dates for milestones\r\n.and regular reports to top management on progress\r\n.Active involvement of audit in the Year 2000 process *\r\nClear contingency plans with trigger dates and *\r\n.procedures for implementation\r\nStrong monitoring of security controls throughout *\r\n.the process\r\n''\r\nطبقا لقرار مصرف لبنان رق 6960 تاريخ 14/5/1998\r\nDISC PD 2000-1 A Definition of Year 2000 Conformity\r\nRequirements\r\nA DEFINITION OF YEAR 2000 CONFORMITY REQUIREMENTS\r\nDISC is a part of the British Standards Institution\r\nWWW. bsi.org.uk\r\nDISC PD 2000-1 A Definition of Year 2000 Conformity\r\nRequirements\r\nA DEFINITION OF YEAR 2000 CONFORMITY REQUIREMENTS\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nThis document addresses what is commonly known as\r\nYear 2000 conformity (also sometimes known as\r\ncentury or millenium compliance). It provides a\r\ndefinition of this expression and requirements that\r\nmust be satisfied in equipment and products which\r\n.use dates and times\r\nIt has been prepared by British Standards Institution\r\ncommittee BBD/1/-/3 in response to demand from UK\r\nindustry, commerce and the public sector. It is the\r\nresult of work from the following bodies whose\r\ncontributions are gratefully acknowledged: BT, Cap\r\nGemini, CCTA, Coopers & Lybrand, Halberstam Elias\r\nICL, National Health Service, National Westminster\r\n.Bank\r\nBSI-DISC would also like to thank the following\r\norganizations for their support and encouragement\r\nin the development of this definition: taskforce 2000\r\nBarclays Bank, British Airways, Cambridgeshire\r\nCounty Council, Computer software Services Association\r\nDepartment of Health, Ernst & Young, Federation of\r\nSmall Business, IBM, ICI, National Power, Paymaster\r\nAgency, Prudential Assurance, Reuters, Tesco Stores\r\nWhile every care has been taken in developing this\r\ndocument, the contributing organizations accept\r\nno liability for any loss or damage caused, arising\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in connection with reliance\r\non its contents except to the extent that such\r\nliability may not be excluded at law. Independent\r\nlegal advice should be sought by any person or\r\norganization intending to enter into a contractual\r\ncommitment relating to Year 2000 conformity\r\n.requirements\r\n''\r\nTHE DEFINITION\r\nYear 2000 conformity shall mean that neither\r\nperformance nor functionality is affected by dates\r\nprior to, during and after the year 2000\r\n:In particular\r\nRule 1. No value for current date will cause any\r\ninterruption in operation\r\nRule 2. Date-based functionality must behave\r\nconsistently for dates prior to during and after\r\n.year 2000\r\nRule 3. In all interfaces and data storage, the\r\ncentury in any date must be specified either\r\nexplicity or by unambiguous algorithms or inferencing\r\n.rules\r\n.Rule 4. Year 2000 must be recognized as a leap year\r\nAMPLIFICATION OF THE DEFINITION AND RULES\r\nGeneral Explanation\r\nProblems can arise from some means of representing\r\ndates in computer equipment and products and from\r\ndate-logic embedded in purchased goods or services\r\nas the year 2000 approaches and during and after\r\nthat year. As a result, equipment or products\r\nincluding embedded control logic, may fail completely\r\n.malfunction or cause data to be corrupted\r\nTo avoid such problems, organizations must check, and\r\nmodify if necessary, internallyh produced equipment\r\nand products and similarly check externally supplied\r\nequipment and products with their suppliers. The\r\npurpose of this document is to allow such checks to\r\n.be made on a basis of common understanding\r\nWhere checks are made with external suppliers, care\r\nshould betaken to distinguish between claims of\r\nconformity and the ability to demonstrate conformity\r\nRule 1\r\n1-1 This rule is sometimes known as general integrity\r\n1-2 If this requirement is satisfied, roll-over\r\nbetween all significant time demarcations (e.g. days\r\nmonths, years, centuries) will be performed correctly\r\n1-3 Current date means today's date as known to the\r\n.equipment or product\r\n''\r\nRule 2\r\n2-1 This rule is sometimes known as date integrity\r\n2-2 This rule means that all equipment and products\r\nmust calculate, manipulate and represent dates\r\ncorrectly for the purposes for which they were\r\n.intended\r\n2-3 The meaning of functionality includes both\r\n.processes and the results of those processes\r\n2-4 If desired, a reference point for date values\r\nand calculations may be added by organizations; e.g\r\n.as defined by the Gregprian calendar\r\n2-5 No equipment or product shall use particular date\r\nvalues for special meanings; e.g. \"99\" to signify\r\nno endvalue\" or \"end of file\" or \"00\" to mean\"\r\n.not applicable\" or \"beginning of file\"\r\nRule 3\r\n3-1 This rule os sometimes known as explicit/implicit\r\n.century\r\n3-2 :It covers two general approaches\r\na) explicit representation of the year in dates)\r\ne.g. by using four digits or by including a century\r\nindicator. In this case, a reference may be\r\ninserted (e.g. 4-digit years as allowed by ISO\r\nstandard 8601:1988) and it may be necessary to\r\nallow for exceptions where domain-specific standards\r\ne.g standards relating to Electronic Data)\r\nInterchange, Automatic Teller Machines or Bankers\r\nAutomated Clearing Services) should have precedence\r\nb) the use of inferencing rules: e.g. two-digit)\r\nyears with a value greater than 50 imply 19xx, those\r\nwith a value equal to or less than 50 imply 20xx\r\nRules for century inferencing as a whole must apply\r\nto all contexts in which the date is used, although\r\ndifferent inferencing rules may apply to different\r\n.date sets\r\nGeneral Notes\r\nFor Rules 1 and 2 in particular, organizations\r\nmay wish to specify allowable ranges for values\r\nof current date and dates to be manipulated. The\r\nranges may relate to one or more of the feasible\r\nlife-span of equipment or products or the span of\r\ndates required to be represented by the organization's\r\nbusiness processes. Tests for specifically critical\r\ndates may also be added (e.g. for leap years, end\r\nofyear, etc). Organizations may wish to append\r\n.additional material in support of local requirements\r\nWhere the term century is used, clear distinction\r\nshould be made between the \"value\" denoting the\r\ncentury (e.g. 20th) and its representation in dates\r\ne.g. 19xx); similarly, 21st and 20xx)\r\nISBN 0 580 29746 2\r\nDISC is a part of the British Standards Institution\r\nCopyright DISC 1995,1996,1997\r\n''\r\nتقرير عن المرحلة الاولى من خطة تلافي مشاكل العام\r\n2000 طبقا لقرار مصرف لبنان رقم 6960 تاريخ 14/5/1998\r\n(يعبأ هذا التقرير ويرسل الى مديرية المعلوماتية في\r\nمصرف لبنان ولجنة الرقابة على المصارف في موعد اقصاه\r\nنهاية شهر اب من العام 1998)\r\nاسم المصرف/المؤسسة: ــــــــــــــ\r\nالتاريخ           : ـــــــــــــــــ\r\nاسماء اعضاء مجموعة العمل او اللجنة المشرفة:"
